# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is a project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using data provided by Yahoo Finance. Used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history.
The forecast has been done using ARIMA model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model. The packages used for visualization include Matplotlib, Plotly.
In this analysis, I have explored the following questions-
I have taken 5 year data for Google, Apple, ford, Tesla, Meta and Nvida from Yahoo Finance
Plot graph for daily, weekly and monthly returns
Plot graph for 5 years trend for all the stocks
Comparison with Arima and Lstm model
